The Product Inventory Management System is a web application designed to help
businesses manage their product inventories. This system allows users to view, add, edit,
and delete products, as well as search for products based on specific criteria. The system is
implemented using Angular for the frontend and integrates with a backend API for data
storage and retrieval. Additionally, the application ensures secure user authentication for
accessing inventory features and includes a simple, user-friendly interface for seamless
navigation.
